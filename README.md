# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

You will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Instructions

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Random Forest Classifier has a higher training and testing score than the linear model.

## Hints and Considerations

* Start by cleaning the data, removing unnecessary columns, and scaling the data.

* Not all variables are significant be sure to remove any insignificant variables.

* Make sure your `sklearn` package is up to date.

* Try a simple model first, and then tune the model using `GridSearch`.
